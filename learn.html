        <h2>Lessons on Online Safety with Cyberfishy</h2>

        <div class="lesson">
            <h3>Lesson 1: Understanding Phishing</h3>
            <p>Meet Cyberfishy, our digital friend who loves to swim through the internet! One day, Cyberfishy received an email that looked official, but something felt off. Phishing is when attackers send deceptive messages to trick users into sharing personal information.</p>
            <p><span>What is Phishing?</span> A tactic used by cybercriminals to obtain sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Suspicious Email Addresses:</span> Check if the sender’s email address looks unusual or contains misspellings.</li>
                <li><span>Generic Greetings:</span> Phishing emails often use generic salutations like "Dear Customer" instead of your name.</li>
                <li><span>Urgent Requests:</span> Many phishing attempts create a sense of urgency, asking you to act quickly.</li>
                <li><span>Links and Attachments:</span> Hover over links to see the actual URL; be cautious of unexpected attachments.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="cyberfishy-tip">Cyberfishy's Tip: Always verify the source before clicking on any links or providing personal information. When in doubt, contact the organization directly using official channels.</div>
        </div>

            <h3>Lesson 2: Recognizing Scams</h3>
            <p>Cyberfishy encountered a message claiming he won a free vacation! Instead of getting excited, Cyberfishy remembered his training. Scammers often use too-good-to-be-true offers to lure victims.</p>
            <p><span>Types of Scams:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Fake Contests and Prizes:</span> Emails that claim you’ve won something you never entered can be scams.</li>
                <li><span>Phishing Schemes:</span> Offers that request sensitive information under the guise of a legitimate business.</li>
                <li><span>Imposter Scams:</span> Messages pretending to be from trusted sources, such as banks or government agencies, asking for personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="cyberfishy-tip">Cyberfishy's Reminder: Always do your research before acting on any unexpected offers. Verify with trusted sources first!</div>
        </div>

            <h3>Lesson 3: Protecting Personal Information</h3>
            <p>While swimming online, Cyberfishy learned that protecting personal information is crucial. He decided to use strong passwords and two-factor authentication to secure his accounts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Use Strong Passwords:</span> Create unique passwords that combine letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
                <li><span>Enable Two-Factor Authentication:</span> Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification.</li>
                <li><span>Be Cautious with Sharing:</span> Only share personal details like addresses or phone numbers with trusted sources.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lesson 4: Safe Social Media Practices</h3>
            <p>Cyberfishy enjoys connecting with friends on social media, but he knows it's essential to stay safe. Understanding privacy settings and limiting personal information shared online helps to avoid unwanted attention.</p>
